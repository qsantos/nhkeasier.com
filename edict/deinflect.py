# deinflect.dat countains instructions to remove inflections from words
# the first line is a header
# the next few lines (without '\t') are a string array refereced to later
# the rest are made of four fields separated by '\t'
#   * first field incdicates the suffix to look for in a candidate
#   * second field indicates when the suffix should be remplaced with
#   * third field helps narrowing down the grammatical class of the candidate
#   * fourth field points to the array string and gives a user-friendly
#     explanation of the removed suffix
# type is a bit field where:
#   * bit 0 hints at a 一段 verb ('v1' marker)
#   * bit 1 hints at a 五段 verb (markers starting with 'v5')
#   * bit 2 hints at a い-adjective (marker 'adj-i')
#   * bit 3 hints at a くる verb (marker 'vk')
#   * bit 4 hints at a す or する verb (markers starting with 'vs-')
#   * bit 7 should always be set for words (so that 0xff & wtype != 0 always)
# for a word, type gives a hint of the expected grammatical class of the word
# for a rule, type[0:8] gives the required grammatical class of original word
# for a rule, type[8:16] gives the grammatical class of the resulting word
# thus, the new word has type wtype = rtyle >> 8
